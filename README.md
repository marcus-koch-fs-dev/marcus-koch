👋 Welcome visitor, nice to see 👀 you here.

I underwent a change in my life from a test engineer🕵️‍ to a web developer🦸‍. Now I'm turning to become a full stack developer focused on the front-end. Creating awesome websites with "React" that provide visitors with unique experiences that will make them want to return, is what I like doing.

If you find my profile interesting, please have a look at my website. There I explain why I have made my career change.

Have fun!
